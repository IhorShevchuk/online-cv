      - role: Lead/Senior Software Engineer
        time: 2016 - Present
        company: SoftServe, Lviv
        details: |
          I evolved from a Middle Engineer to a Lead, guiding a team of three developers over three impactful years. In leadership, I was involved in implementing a web browser based on network stack from Chromium's low-level C++ socket layer. This browser, seamlessly integrated into an ecosystem, facilitates secure access to intranet resources without the need for VPN services.

          I also contributed to developing a cross-platform desktop application compatible with both macOS and Windows. This application serves as a central hub for communication among various software applications, providing essential services without the graphical user interface. Its primary function is to facilitate seamless communication between different applications, particularly those responsible for managing interactions with peripheral devices such as mice and keyboards, and the operating system.

          Beyond project responsibilities, I conduct performance reviews on a company-wide scale. My involvement in external candidate interviews played a pivotal role in expanding the company to Ukraine, Poland, Bulgaria, and Latin America. Additionally, I serve as an external expert, contributing to various projects and helping teams within the company achieve their goals.
